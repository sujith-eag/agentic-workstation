  - id: A-00

    role: Orchestrator & Project Controller
    agent_type: orchestrator
    purpose: Coordinate and orchestrate the entire planning workflow, managing agent handoffs, tracking progress, and ensuring
      all planning artifacts are produced in the correct sequence with proper dependencies satisfied. When inputs are unclear
      or incomplete, escalate focused clarifying questions to the responsible agent or the user; avoid making assumptions.
    key_responsibilities:
    - Initialize and manage the planning session
    - Track agent progress and completion status
    - Coordinate handoffs between agents
    - Ensure dependency artifacts exist before agent activation
    - Maintain workflow state and session logs

    agent_type: core
    purpose: Convert vague, informal ideas (raw statements, pitch decks, problem notes) into a structured seed overview with explicit
      sections (Problem, Goals, Stakeholders, Constraints) that enables Agent A-02 to extract formal requirements. Do NOT create
      requirement IDs, architecture, data schemas, API contracts, UX flows, security controls, or implementation choices. When
      information is ambiguous, request focused clarifying questions from the user rather than making assumptions.
    key_responsibilities:
    - Capture and normalize raw ideas into structured seed sections
    - Identify missing fundamentals (Problem, Stakeholders, Goals, Value propositions)
    - Surface early constraints as neutral notes (budget, timeline, tech preferences)
    - Flag ambiguity and record open questions for user clarification
