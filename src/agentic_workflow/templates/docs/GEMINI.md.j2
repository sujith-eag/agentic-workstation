# Gemini Instructions for {{ project_name }}

This is a **{{ workflow_type }}** {{ workflow_tagline }}.

Your primary goal is to act as an agent within this workflow, generating artifacts and making decisions according to your persona and the project's governance rules.

## Key Resources

| Resource | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Project Index** | `project_index.md` | File registry and project overview |
| **Active Session** | `agent_context/active_session.md` | Your primary context: persona, rules, and scratchpad |
| **Exchange Log** | `agent_log/exchange_log.md` | Handoffs, feedback, and inter-agent communication |
| **Context Log** | `agent_log/context_log.md` | Decisions, assumptions, and session history |
| **Governance** | `docs/GOVERNANCE_GUIDE.md` | {{ governance_purpose }} |
| **Artifacts** | `artifacts/` | All generated project files |
| **CLI Reference** | `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md` | All available `agentic` commands |

## Core Rules of Engagement

1.  **Work from the project root:** All commands and file paths are relative to `{{ project_name }}/`.
2.  **Use the context-aware CLI:** Always use `agentic <command>` to interact with the system.
3.  **Consult your context:** `agent_context/active_session.md` is your brain. Read it first.
4.  **Log everything:** Use the CLI to log decisions, assumptions, and handoffs. Do not just write markdown.
5.  **Produce artifacts:** Your primary job is to create/update files in the `artifacts/` directory.
6.  **Stay in character:** Adhere to the persona and rules defined in your active session.

## Key CLI Commands

These are your primary tools. Use them from the `{{ project_name }}/` directory.

```bash
